 Places the card reader in a scan only mode.
 Please use the enableScannerWithMultiScan: instead of enableScanner:
 *The card reader then waits for the scan button(s) to be pressed and once detected will activate the scanner hardware.
 *When a scanned code is detected the card reader will emit scan event notifications back to the caller, which the caller application can catch and display to the operator.
 *To stop scan mode call disableScanner.
 *Scan mode is automatically disabled after a period of inactivity, on the card reader.
 multi_scan      true - [default] multiple scan codes can be scanned, resulting in multiple scan events. Scan mode must be esplicitly cancelled.
 *                      false - scan mode will be disabled as soon as one barcode has been detected
 buttonless_mode true - [default] The operator needs to press the scan buttons to activate the scanner (during scan mode).
 *                      false - The scanner will be turned on immediately and kept on for the duration of the scan mode.
 timeoutSeconds         0 - [default] The card reader will determine when scanning should time out.
